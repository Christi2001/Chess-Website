# Chess-Website
### by Christian Constantin Pustianu
This is a website for chess amateurs to learn the basics of chess and explore the world of professional chess.  
The project was done for a University module at my course.
The website can be accessed [here](https://christian-pustianu.github.io/Chess-Website/Home.html).
